Course Scheduler Final   Project   Part   2
This   part of the   Final   Project is a continuation of Part   1 and   will   add   additional   functions for both the Admin User   and the   Student   User.
This assignment is the   last half of the final project   and will   be   submitted   as   Final   Project   Part 2.
This phase of the project will implement the following additional Admin functions:
Display Class   List of   Students
Display all the students who are scheduled or waitlisted for   the specified   class   for the   current semester. The scheduled students should be displayed first and then the waitlisted students in waitlist   order.
Drop Student
Remove the student from the list of students and remove   them   from   any   classes
they are scheduled for in all semesters. For   each   course   they   were   scheduled   in,
schedule the first student on the waitlist into the course.   Display all   of the changes   that   are made because   of dropping the   student.
Drop ClassRemove the specified course from the current semester. Remove all   students      scheduled and waitlisted for the class from the Schedule Table. Display all   of the   changes that are made because   of dropping the   class.
This phase of the project will implement the following additional Student function:
Drop Class
Remove the specified class from the student’s schedule for the current semester.   The   student may be scheduled for the class or   on the   waitlist.   Schedule   the   first   student   waiting for the class into the class. Display all   of the changes   that   are   made   because   of   dropping the class.
Testing scenario:
A testing scenario will be provided to assist you   in testing this   application.   It will   be   called Final   Project Part   2 Test   Script   in   Canvas.
Database considerations:
Your database will be identical to your database from   Part   1. All of the tables   should   be empty when your project   is   submitted.
GUI Guidelines:
The user should be required to enter   only   unknown   data.   D代 写Course Scheduler Final Project Part 2
代做程序编程语言rop   down   lists   of   known
data such as Student names, Course Codes, or   Semesters   should   be   displayed for   the
user to select. Combo   Boxes should be used for the   drop-down   lists   on   the   form.   When   information is requested to be displayed, e.g.,   for   a   Display   command,   all   of the
requested   information must be displayed. When a   command   is   performed, the   results   of   that command should be displayed to   the user on the   same   display   without   the   user
needing to use a Display function   to   see   what   was   done.
Submission Guidelines:
Don't forget to submit your zipped PROJECT   folder and your zipped   DATABASE
folder as you did for Part   1. Zip the ENTIRE   database   folder   and the   ENTIRE   project   folder and submit the two zipped files in the assignment under one   submission.
Note:
Your project must be named   as   it was   for   Part   1. The   database   must   be   named   as   it   was for Part   1. All tables should be   empty.
Grading Criteria:
In this project I will   be looking for good   OO design   practices   and this   includes:
•             Use   of getter and   setter   methods for   class variables
•             Good naming   of your classes,   methods   and variables
•             Correct   use   of static   and   non-static   methods
•             The way you split   this   project   into   classes.
•             All of your updates to the database   must   be done   using   SQL   statements,   do   not use ResultSetTableModels   to update the   database.
•             If a SQL statement to   update the   database   needs   to   contain   a variable,   then   you must use   PreparedStatements, do not use   concatenation   of strings   to
create the SQL statement.
The Grading   Rubric for   Final   Project   Part   2 is posted in   Canvas.
Note:   Make sure you look at all the videos   about this assignment and the   Course   Scheduler   Design Layout in Canvas   before starting this   assignment.
